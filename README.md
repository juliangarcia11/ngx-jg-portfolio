# NgX Portfolio
_by Julian Garcia_

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.4.

## Goals
1. Create a fun way to interact with various public APIs & libraries I have come across.

_...WIP_


## Recommendations
1. **DO** use the Angular CLI to generate scaffolded items.
2. **DO** generate scaffolded items **WITH** test files.
3. **DO** use test driven development.

_...WIP_

### Original README (for reference)
#### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

#### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

#### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

#### Running end-to-end tests (not currently implemented 2023-02-15)

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
